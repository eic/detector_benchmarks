Detector Benchmark for tracking performance with DIS events
============================================================

## Overview
This benchmark generates and reconstructs DIS events. The generated charged-particle spectra is then compared to the spectra of truth-seeded and real-seeded reconstructed tracks. The hit-based track purity is also plotted.
