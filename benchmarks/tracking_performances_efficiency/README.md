Detector Benchmark for single-particle track reconstrution efficiency
=====================================================================

## Overview
This benchmark generates single charged particle (negative muon) events. The events are simulated and reconstructed using the standard ePIC software. The efficiency of real-seeded track reconstruction is then extracted and plotted as a function of the generated particle's vertex, momentum, and angle.
