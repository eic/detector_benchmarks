Detector Benchmark for LYSO ZDC
===============================

## Overview
This benchmark generates events with single low-energy (5 MeV - 1 GeV) photons. The photons are generated with angles of 0-5.24 mRad with respect to the proton/ion beam direction. The benchmark creates performance plots of the LYSO ZDC acceptance and energy reconstruction resolution.
