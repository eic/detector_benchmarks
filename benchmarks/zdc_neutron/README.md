Detector Benchmark for single neutron in the ZDC
=================================================

## Overview
This benchmark generates single-neutron events. The neutrons are generated with 100 GeV total momentum; polar angles of 0-6.5 mRad with respect to the proton/ion beam direction, uniform over cosine of the polar angle; and uniform azimuthal angles with respect to the proton/ion beam direction. The benchmark creates acceptance and reconstruction performance plots.
