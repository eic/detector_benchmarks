## =============================================================================
## Global configuration variables for the benchmark scripts
## The script defines the following environment variables that are meant to
## be overriden by the Gitlab continuous integration (CI)
##
##  - JUGGLER_DETECTOR:       detector package to be used for the benchmark
##  - JUGGLER_N_EVENTS:       #events processed by simulation/reconstruction
##  - JUGGLER_INSTALL_PREFIX: location where Juggler (digi/recon) is installed
##  - JUGGLER_N_THREADS:      Number of threads/processes to spawn in parallel
##  - JUGGLER_RNG_SEED:       Random seed for the RNG
##
## It also defines the following additional variables for internal usage
##  - LOCAL_PREFIX:           prefix for packages installed during the benchmark
##  - DETECTOR_PREFIX:        prefix for the detector definitions
##  - DETECTOR_PATH:          actual path with the detector definitions
##
## Finally, it makes sure LOCAL_PREFIX and JUGGLER_PREFIX are added to PATH
## and LD_LIBRARY_PATH

## in case you would like to modify the detector package or
## number of events to be analyzed during the benchmark

##  spawn).
